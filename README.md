# RSS-Feed-Aggregator
Hi, this is an RSS-Feed-Aggregator that is built in Go and ultilizes PostresSQL for the database and queries. The code imports goose to modularize tabble creations/updates and sqlc to transform the queries into executable go code. The applications launches a server using go-chi and implements RestAPI functionality through GET, PUT and DELETE requests. The user type HTTP requests implement a user Authentication ApiKey to ensure security and profile management. The RestAPI utilizes a scrapper worker to continuously call a RSS feed link for updated blog/artcile posts which are then stored in the local Postgres database.

Future Developement: This is just the start for this project. I plan to implement a CLI to execute HTTP Requests quick and efficiently instead of using ThunderClient. Additionally, implementing OAuth and a frontend webpage to allows users to interact with RestAPI. All of this entails containerizing the project, deploying the Postgres database on a cloud provider, and many other developement processes to deploy the application.
